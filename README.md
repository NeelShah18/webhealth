## Title: US food pattern and its effect on health based on social media giant - twitter data in 2017-2018

## About project: We have 30 million twitter data of recent years 2017-18 about the health system of US. Its web health informative system in which we retrieve the information about the food habits, per day calorie consumption, prediction of disease as per food habits among people in different states of US.[#Progress]

## Backend:
We are using three technology in backend.
1. Python: Python is very object oriented programing specially for data analysis and frequency analysis of data. Our project contains large amount of analysis part.
2. Falcon: It is api technology to create for large scale data transfer. It is design specially for dashboard type data transfer.
3. Gunicorn: It is main server where all our core api run top of it. Strength of this server is that, it can handle one million of request in anyschronize maner.

## Frontend: 
1. Angular 4: AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. AngularJS’s data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.
2. Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
3. HTML5: HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.

## Flow:
1. Step 1: Take large US twitter dataset and perform data analysis and based on that generate information.
2. Step 2: Create base server based which handle all process from login, signup, transferring data for graphs and other information based on API.
3. Step 3: With API, create UI which is user friendly and user interactive.
4. Step 4: Test user security, privacy and performance of system.
5. Step 5: Create a WIKI to help understand the whole system for easy future enhancements to the system.
